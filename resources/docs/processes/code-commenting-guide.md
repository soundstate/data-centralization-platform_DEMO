## üìù Detailed Comment Type Reference

### `!` Important/Critical Comments
**Visual**: Bold yellow text (`#D6B85A`)  
**Purpose**: Mark sections where large amounts of data are processed or created, critical business logic, or performance-sensitive code.

```python
# ! This function processes 10,000+ API data points - memory intensive
def process_all_correlations():
    correlations = fetch_all_correlations()
    
# ! Critical: This calculation affects statistical significance testing
correlation_strength = calculate_correlation_coefficient(dataset_a, dataset_b)
```

**When to use:**
- High-volume data processing operations
- Critical statistical analysis that affects correlation accuracy
- Performance bottlenecks or memory-intensive operations
- AI model training and embedding generation
- Security-sensitive API token handling

### `?` Questions/Clarifications
**Visual**: Italic blue text (`#82AAFF`)  
**Purpose**: Mark open questions about functionality, unclear requirements, or areas needing clarification.

```python
# ? Should this include confidence intervals or just correlation coefficient?
def calculate_correlation_strength(dataset_a, dataset_b):
    return pearson_correlation(dataset_a, dataset_b)

# ? Is this the correct temporal window for weather-music correlation?
temporal_window = timedelta(days=7)
```

**When to use:**
- Unclear statistical methodology decisions
- Uncertain correlation interpretation approaches
- Areas requiring domain expert input
- Code that may need revision based on data analysis results
- Questions about causation vs. correlation handling

### `//` Removed/Deprecated Code
**Visual**: Strikethrough italic gray text (`#5C6370`)

```python
# // Old hardcoded approach - replaced with environment config
# SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = "abcd1234567890"

# // Legacy synchronous processing - migrate to async
# def old_process_correlations(data):
#     return process_sync(data)
```

**When to use:**
- Code removed during refactoring but kept for reference

# dev_cmt Add caching layer for frequently accessed correlations
def fetch_correlation_data(correlation_id):
    return correlation_db.get_correlation(correlation_id)

# dev_cmt Implement batch processing for large embedding generations
# dev_cmt Consider adding retry logic with exponential backoff
def generate_all_embeddings():
    pass
```

**When to use:**
- Feature enhancements for future demo versions
- Performance improvement ideas for large datasets
- Code optimization opportunities for correlation analysis
- Integration possibilities with new data sources

### `bug_cmt` Known Issues
**Visual**: Bold red text (`#C75C6A`)  
**Purpose**: Document known bugs, issues, or problematic behavior that needs to be addressed.

```python
# bug_cmt Race condition when multiple API clients access same endpoint
def fetch_api_data(endpoint):
    # Temporary workaround with random delay
    time.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 0.5))
    
# bug_cmt Memory leak in long-running correlation analysis - monitor usage
def process_large_correlation_dataset(correlations):
    processed = []
    for correlation in correlations:
        processed.append(analyze_correlation(correlation))
    return processed
```

**When to use:**
- Known bugs that haven't been fixed yet
- Workarounds for external API limitations (Spotify, GitHub, etc.)
- Performance issues under investigation
- Edge cases that cause unexpected statistical behavior
- Correlation analysis anomalies requiring investigation

---

### `legacy_cmt` Legacy Documentation
**Visual**: Bold gray text (`#4B5263`)  
**Purpose**: Describe what code used to do, why it was removed, or provide context about previous implementations.

```python
# legacy_cmt This used to handle synchronous API calls before async implementation
# legacy_cmt Previous implementation used hardcoded API keys instead of environment config
def get_api_config():
    return os.getenv("SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID")

# legacy_cmt Original SQLite database replaced with PostgreSQL + pgvector
class DatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.setup_postgresql_connection()
```

**When to use:**
- Explaining removed functionality
- Providing context for architectural changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Be Specific**: Use descriptive text after the comment tag
2. **Keep Updated**: Remove or update comments as code evolves
3. **Use Consistently**: Follow the established patterns across the codebase
4. **Single Purpose**: Each comment should address one specific concern
5. **AI Training**: Use these comments to train AI agents on proper development practices
6. **Statistical Context**: Include statistical methodology context where relevant
7. **Portfolio Value**: Comments should demonstrate professional development thinking

### Comment Placement
- Place comments **above** the relevant code block
- Use inline comments sparingly and only for critical clarifications
- Group related comments together when addressing the same section

### Example Usage in Context
```python
from packages.shared_core.api.clients.spotify import SpotifyAPIClient
from packages.shared_core.utils.statistical import CorrelationAnalyzer

class MusicWeatherCorrelator:
    def __init__(self):
        # ! Critical: Ensure API client is properly authenticated before use
        self.spotify_client = SpotifyAPIClient()
        
        # todo_cmt Validate environment configuration on startup
        self.correlation_threshold = float(os.getenv("CORRELATION_THRESHOLD", "0.5"))
        
    def analyze_weather_music_correlation(self, music_data, weather_data):
        # ? Should we use Pearson or Spearman correlation for this analysis?
        correlations = []
        
        for music_item in music_data:
            # dev_cmt Add validation for required audio features
            processed = self.extract_audio_features(music_item)
            
            # bug_cmt Occasionally fails with None values - needs investigation
            if processed:
                correlation = self.calculate_correlation(processed, weather_data)
                
                # ! Critical: Statistical significance testing required
                if correlation.p_value < 0.05:
                    correlations.append(correlation)
                
        # legacy_cmt Used to write to local files before PostgreSQL storage
        return self.save_to_database(correlations)
        
    # warp_cmt Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
    def save_to_database(self, correlations):
        # // Old JSON file approach
        # with open('correlations.json', 'w') as f:
        #     json.dump(correlations, f)
        
        return database_client.store_correlations(correlations)
```
