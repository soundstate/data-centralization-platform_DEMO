# Feature Planning

This section contains templates and processes for planning new features in the JS codebase. Proper feature planning ensures that new functionality is well-designed, properly scoped, and aligned with business requirements.

## Planning Process

### 1. Feature Proposal
Start with the [Feature Proposal Template](./feature-proposal-template.md) to document:
- Business justification and requirements
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Resource requirements and timeline

### 2. Stakeholder Review
- Present proposal to relevant stakeholders
- Gather feedback and requirements clarification
- Refine scope and priorities
- Obtain approval to proceed

### 3. Technical Design
- Create detailed technical specifications
- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Plan database schema changes if needed
- Design API endpoints and data structures

### 4. Implementation Planning
- Break down work into manageable tasks
- Estimate effort and create timeline
- Identify risks and mitigation strategies
- Plan testing approach

## When to Use Feature Planning

### Always Required:
- New user-facing features
- Significant backend functionality changes
- Database schema modifications
- API changes that affect external systems
- Features requiring multi-sprint development

### Optional (but recommended):
- Minor UI improvements
- Bug fixes that require architectural changes
- Performance optimizations
- Developer tooling improvements

## Working with AI Tools

When using Warp Terminal and Claude for feature development:

1. **Start with the template**: Use the feature proposal template to structure your requirements
2. **Collaborate with AI**: Share your feature proposal with Claude to get technical insights
3. **Iterate on design**: Use AI assistance to refine technical approaches
4. **Document decisions**: Keep track of AI-suggested solutions and rationale

## Templates Available

- **[Feature Proposal Template](./feature-proposal-template.md)** - Complete feature planning template
- **[Example: User Authentication Feature](./examples/user-authentication-feature.md)** - Real-world example

## Best Practices

- **Start small**: Begin with minimal viable features and iterate
- **Consider users**: Always include user impact assessment
- **Think integration**: Consider how features interact with existing systems
- **Plan for testing**: Include testing strategy in initial planning
- **Document assumptions**: Make implicit requirements explicit
- **Consider maintenance**: Plan for ongoing support and updates

## Review Checklist

Before moving to implementation, ensure your feature plan includes:

- [ ] Clear problem statement and business justification
- [ ] Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Technical feasibility assessment
- [ ] Dependency analysis
- [ ] Resource estimation
- [ ] Risk assessment
- [ ] Testing strategy
- [ ] Deployment plan
- [ ] Success metrics

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Scope creep**: Keep initial scope focused and manageable
- **Under-estimating complexity**: Always add buffer time for unexpected issues
- **Ignoring dependencies**: Map out all system dependencies early
- **Skipping user research**: Validate assumptions with actual users
- **Over-engineering**: Build for current needs, not hypothetical future requirements
