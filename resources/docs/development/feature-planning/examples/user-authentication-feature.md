# Feature Proposal: User Authentication System

## Feature Overview

**Feature Name**: Enhanced User Authentication System

**Proposed By**: Development Team

**Date**: July 16, 2025

**Status**: Approved

**Priority**: High

## Problem Statement

### Business Problem
The current system lacks a robust user authentication mechanism, leading to security vulnerabilities and poor user experience. Users must re-enter credentials frequently, and there's no role-based access control for different system features.

### User Impact
- Users experience frustration with frequent login prompts
- Security concerns due to weak password requirements
- Administrators cannot control user access to specific features
- No audit trail for user actions
- Mobile users have particularly poor experience

### Current Workarounds
- Users often use weak passwords to avoid re-entering complex ones
- Manual user management through direct database access
- No proper session management leads to security risks
- Administrators use spreadsheets to track user permissions

## Proposed Solution

### Solution Overview
Implement a comprehensive authentication system with JWT tokens, role-based access control, secure session management, and multi-factor authentication support.

### Key Features
- Secure user registration and login with strong password requirements
- JWT-based session management with automatic refresh
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, User roles)
- Multi-factor authentication using email/SMS
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management
- Session timeout and security controls
- Audit logging for authentication events

### Success Metrics
- Reduce authentication-related support tickets by 75%
- Increase user session duration by 200%
- Achieve 99.9% authentication system uptime
- Implement security compliance requirements (SOC 2 Type II)
