# Implementation

This section contains implementation guides, templates, and best practices for converting feature proposals into working code. The implementation phase is where detailed technical planning meets actual development.

## Implementation Process

### 1. Technical Design Review
Before starting implementation, ensure the feature proposal has been:
- Technically reviewed and approved
- Broken down into specific tasks
- Dependencies identified and resolved
- Architecture decisions finalized

### 2. Implementation Planning
Use the [Implementation Template](./implementation-template.md) to create a detailed plan that includes:
- Technical specifications
- Task breakdown and sequencing
- Code structure and organization
- Integration points and dependencies
- Testing strategy and acceptance criteria

### 3. Development Execution
- Follow the planned task sequence
- Implement in small, testable increments
- Regular progress reviews and adjustments
- Continuous integration and testing

### 4. Documentation and Handoff
- Update technical documentation
- Create or update user guides
- Prepare deployment documentation
- Knowledge transfer to operations team

## When to Create Implementation Plans

### Always Required:
- Features with multiple developers
- Complex technical integration
- Database schema changes
- API modifications affecting multiple systems
- Features requiring staged rollout

### Recommended:
- Features with external dependencies
- Performance-critical implementations
- Security-sensitive features
- Features requiring specialized knowledge

## Working with AI-Assisted Development

The implementation templates are designed to work effectively with AI tools like Claude:

### 1. Share Implementation Plans
- Provide complete implementation plans to Claude
- Include technical specifications and constraints
- Share code examples and patterns from existing codebase

### 2. Iterative Development
- Use AI for code generation and review
- Validate AI suggestions against implementation plan
- Document AI-generated solutions and reasoning

### 3. Problem-Solving Collaboration
- Present technical challenges to AI with full context
- Use AI for debugging and optimization suggestions
- Leverage AI for code refactoring and improvements

## Implementation Templates

- **[Implementation Template](./implementation-template.md)** - Comprehensive implementation planning template
- **[Example: API Endpoint Implementation](./examples/api-endpoint-implementation.md)** - Real-world implementation example

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Follow existing codebase patterns and conventions
- Create modular, reusable components
- Implement proper error handling throughout
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Development Workflow
- Create feature branches for all work
- Implement in small, reviewable commits
- Write tests before or during implementation
- Regular code reviews and pair programming

### Technical Standards
- Follow security best practices
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Optimize for performance and scalability
- Document complex business logic

### Quality Assurance
- Unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance testing for critical paths
- Security testing for sensitive features

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Database Integration
- Plan schema changes carefully
- Implement proper migrations
- Consider data consistency and integrity
- Plan for rollback scenarios

### API Integration
- Design consistent API patterns
- Implement proper error handling
- Version APIs appropriately
- Document all endpoints thoroughly

### Frontend Integration
- Follow UI/UX design patterns
- Implement responsive design
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Optimize for performance

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT token handling
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Security middleware

### Data Processing
- Input validation and sanitization
- Business logic separation
- Data transformation pipelines
- Error handling and logging

### API Development
- RESTful endpoint design
- Request/response formatting
- Error response standards
- API versioning strategies

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Version mismatches, circular dependencies
- **Performance Problems**: Database queries, memory usage, API response times
- **Integration Issues**: Service communication, data format mismatches
- **Testing Challenges**: Test data setup, mocking external services

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Isolate the Issue**: Reproduce in minimal environment
2. **Gather Information**: Logs, error messages, system state
3. **Consult Documentation**: Check implementation plan and technical docs
4. **Seek Help**: Use AI assistance, team consultation, external resources
5. **Document Solution**: Update troubleshooting guide and knowledge base
