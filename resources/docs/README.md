## Quick Start for New Features

When developing a new feature with Warp Terminal and Claude, follow this workflow:

1. **Plan**: Create a feature proposal using the [Feature Planning Template](./development/feature-planning/feature-proposal-template.md)
2. **Design**: Develop implementation plan using the [Implementation Template](./development/implementation/implementation-template.md)
3. **Document**: Update technical documentation as you build
4. **Test**: Follow the [Testing Strategy](./development/testing/testing-strategy.md)
5. **Deploy**: Use the [Deployment Checklist](./development/deployment/deployment-checklist.md)

## Contributing to Documentation
