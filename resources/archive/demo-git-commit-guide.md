# 📝 Commit Message Guidelines

revised: 07/09/2025

This project uses the **Conventional Commits** format to ensure clean, readable commit history and compatibility with changelog generators and CI tools.

## ✅ Format

<type>(optional-scope): short summary

- `type`: the kind of change being made (see below)
- `scope`: optional, describes the area of the code affected (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`)
- `summary`: a concise, imperative description (e.g., `add login validation`, not `added` or `adds`)

## 🛠 Best Practices

- Limit the summary to **72 characters or fewer**
- Use **present tense** and **imperative mood** (e.g., “add”, not “added”)
- Capitalization: lowercase after the colon unless it's a proper noun
- Keep your commit history clean and focused—**one purpose per commit**
