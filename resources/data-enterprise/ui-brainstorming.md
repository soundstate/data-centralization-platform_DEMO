# 🎨 UI Architecture & User Experience Planning
updated: 01/20/25

## Project Overview
Planning the user interface architecture for an On-Premises LLM-as-a-Service platform targeting SMBs (50-200 employees). The system needs to support multiple client subscriptions while maintaining data privacy through on-premises deployment.

## Current Implementation Status
**Implementation Phase**: Planning & Architecture Design

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Multi-Tenant SaaS Model**: Individual client subscriptions with isolated data environments
- **On-Premises Deployment**: LLM and data processing occurs within client networks
- **Subscription Management**: Annual tiers with usage tracking and billing controls
- **Enterprise Security**: Role-based access with audit trails and compliance features
- **SMB-Focused UX**: Simplified interfaces designed for non-technical business users

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Decision: Hybrid SaaS + On-Premises Model

### Recommended Approach: **Split Architecture**

#### **Cloud-Hosted Management Portal (React SaaS App)**
- **Subscription management** and billing
- **Client onboarding** and account setup
- **Support ticketing** and documentation
- **Usage analytics** and reporting dashboards
- **License key** generation and validation

#### **On-Premises Client Application (React + Electron or Web App)**
- **Data analysis** interface and LLM interaction
- **Local data** visualization and insights
- **User management** within organization
- **Custom report** generation and export
- **Training** and fine-tuning interfaces

### Why This Split Architecture?

**✅ Advantages:**
- **Data Privacy**: Sensitive business data never leaves client premises
- **Subscription Control**: Easy to manage renewals, billing, and access remotely
- **Scalability**: Cloud portal scales independently of client installations
- **Compliance**: Meets data residency and security requirements
- **Support Efficiency**: Central support portal with remote diagnostics

**⚠️ Considerations:**
- **Dual Development**: Need to maintain two separate applications
- **Synchronization**: License validation between cloud and on-premises
- **Deployment Complexity**: On-premises installation and updates

## 🔐 Multi-Tenancy & Subscription Management

### **Subscription Control Mechanisms**

#### **License Validation System**
```typescript
// On-premises license checking
interface LicenseValidation {
  clientId: string;
  subscriptionTier: 'Starter' | 'Professional' | 'Enterprise';
  expirationDate: Date;
  maxUsers: number;
  maxDataVolume: number; // in TB
  features: string[];
  isActive: boolean;
}

// Regular license validation (daily check)
async function validateLicense(licenseKey: string) {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/license/validate`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${licenseKey}` }
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

#### **Feature Gating Strategy**
```typescript
// Component-level feature gating
const useFeatureAccess = (feature: string) => {
  const { subscription } = useAuth();
  return subscription.features.includes(feature);
};

// Usage in components
function AdvancedAnalytics() {
  const hasAdvancedFeatures = useFeatureAccess('advanced-analytics');
  
  if (!hasAdvancedFeatures) {
    return <UpgradePrompt feature="Advanced Analytics" />;
  }
  
  return <AdvancedAnalyticsInterface />;
}
```

#### **Usage Tracking & Limits**
```typescript
// Track usage against subscription limits
interface UsageMetrics {
  dataVolumeUsed: number; // in GB
  activeUsers: number;
  queriesPerMonth: number;
  modelTrainingHours: number;
}

// Usage enforcement
const useUsageLimits = () => {
  const checkDataLimit = (newDataSize: number) => {
    const totalUsed = currentUsage.dataVolumeUsed + newDataSize;
    return totalUsed <= subscription.maxDataVolume;
  };
  
  const checkUserLimit = () => {
    return activeUsers.length < subscription.maxUsers;
  };
  
  return { checkDataLimit, checkUserLimit };
};
```

### **Billing Integration Points**

#### **Cloud Portal Billing Dashboard**
```typescript
// Subscription management interface
- Current plan and usage visualization
- Upgrade/downgrade options
- Payment method management
- Invoice history and downloads
- Usage alerts and notifications
```

#### **On-Premises Usage Reporting**
```typescript
// Automated usage data sync
- Daily usage metrics upload
- Feature usage analytics
- Performance benchmarking
- Error reporting and diagnostics
```

## 📊 Key UI/UX Considerations for SMBs

### **Simplicity First Design Principles**

#### **1. Progressive Disclosure**
- **Basic Interface**: Simple query input and results display
- **Advanced Features**: Hidden behind "Advanced" toggles
- **Expert Mode**: Full feature access for power users

#### **2. Business-Focused Language**
```typescript
// Avoid technical jargon in UI
❌ "Execute SQL query on normalized data schema"
✅ "Find insights in your business data"

❌ "Fine-tune transformer model parameters"
✅ "Improve AI accuracy for your industry"

❌ "Configure RAG pipeline embeddings"
✅ "Connect your documents for smarter answers"
```

#### **3. Guided Workflows**
```typescript
// Step-by-step onboarding
const OnboardingFlow = () => {
  return (
    <WizardSteps>
      <Step title="Connect Your Data">
        <DataSourceWizard />
      </Step>
      <Step title="Ask Your First Question">
        <GuidedQueryBuilder />
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create Your Dashboard">
        <DashboardBuilder />
      </Step>
    </WizardSteps>
  );
};
```

### **Mobile and Responsive Considerations**

#### **Executive Mobile Experience**
```typescript
// Mobile-first executive dashboard
- Key metrics at-a-glance
- Offline report viewing
- Push notifications for alerts
- Voice query input option
- Quick actions and approvals
```

#### **Responsive Design Strategy**
```css
/* Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes */
.dashboard-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}

/* Mobile-specific optimizations */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .chart-container {
    height: 250px; /* Shorter charts on mobile */
  }
  
  .data-table {
    font-size: 14px; /* Smaller text for mobile */
  }
}
```
