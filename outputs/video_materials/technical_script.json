The data ingestion layer handles multiple protocols - REST APIs, real-time streaming, and batch processing. Everything flows through our correlation engine, powered by advanced statistical algorithms and machine learning models. The semantic layer uses GPT-4 for natural language processing, while the visualization engine provides real-time interactive dashboards.",
